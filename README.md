## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ x ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ x ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ x ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ x ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ x ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ x ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ x ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ x ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ x ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ x ] More than 4 functional game buttons

- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   I used the links provided e.g. css colors:
   
    https://www.rapidtables.com/web/css/css-color.html
    
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd_rLsJGtts
    
    https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   Just the general challenges in coding like googling specifics. Thankfully, the provided links were very helpful, at least for the basic implementation. For example, before I started following along, I watched the YouTube video and I was looking up background colors. And so, in general for problems, the mantra is to find a problem you don't understand and break it down into chunks until you find a chunk you cannot solve. That is the chunk that you now need to ponder or google about. Web dev is exciting!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   I can envision the amount of work front-end developers do! Although this was a simple example, I can see how much work one could do to change what would otherwise seem trivial to the user as they use a website. Front-end developers have my deepest appreciation! I am excited to check out how back-end dev is and I wonder how do we efficiently debug since we don't have a visual product to test with. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   I would definitely attempt the rest of the optional features! Because of a busy term at school right now, I mostly followed along with the tutorial. I would also perhaps add some kind of functionality such that the computer picks random verses from nursery rhymes and matches the sounds of those verses to the button frequencies. If the player catches on to the pattern, they get a bonus congrats message!
